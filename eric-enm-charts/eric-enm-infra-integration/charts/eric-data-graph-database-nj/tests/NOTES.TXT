These scripts are being used for tests purposes exclusively. 
So is not recommended to be used on production environments because it could causes undesired results.

basicloadtest.sh

This script identifies the number of pods and the role of each one of them. 
It also identifies the neo4j container due it will be required for the database calls.
Based in the pod role, it makes basic calls using cypher-shell:

+----------+-------------------------------------------+
| POD type |  Database query language                  |
+----------+-------------------------------------------+
| LEADER   | CREATE (a:Artist { Name : '$RNDSTRING' }) |
+----------+-------------------------------------------+
| FOLLOWER | MATCH (artist:Artist) RETURN artist.Name  |
+----------+-------------------------------------------+
| REPLICA  | MATCH (n) RETURN count(n)                 |
+----------+-------------------------------------------+

Syntax: 
./basicloadtest.sh -h  (To get help)
   Usage: ./basicloadtest.sh {-t total}
   t: Total number of Inserts done in neo4j DB, default is 10 inserts

The script will identify each role:
* if LEADER role is identified it will insert a number (default is 10) of basic nodes (Artist) 
* If FOLLOWER or REPLICA is identified it just return each Node or the number of nodes added

The script will drop the entire database once it finish the execution.
