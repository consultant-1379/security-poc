testsuite to allow CREDM CONTROLLER to run in a test environment
================================================================

simpleSPS: create a service with PODs with the credm-api.version label
it allows credm-controller to pass init-container
to run : ./helm.sh start
Once launched, credm-controller will pass init and become ready

NOTE: to be used also to see how to configure label in SPS deployment

service: create a simple service running 5 PODs and with the required certReqSecret and tlsSecret
it also run a postinstall hook job sending the "Install" REST to credm-controller
this job waits until receive answer from credm-controller
the PODs will stay in init phase until the certReqSecret does not contain the "ready" state

each area contain the image and the chart to install it separately

test_install contains copies of charts to install them all together
